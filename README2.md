- Date/time selection with validation.  };

- Booking history and status tracking.}

```

### 4. Product & Cart System

- Product catalog and details from sample data.### 4. E-commerce Features

- Add/remove products to/from cart.```typescript

- Responsive layouts using CSS Grid/Flexbox.    items: CartItem[];

- RTL support via dedicated CSS.  };

}

### 7. Utilities & Helpers```

- Custom React hooks for auth and local storage.

- Utility functions for date formatting and constants.### 5. Dashboard Requirements

#### Admin Dashboard

### 8. Data & State Management- Real-time statistics rendering

- Sample data in `src/data/` for products, services, users, etc.- Data aggregation for analytics

- Local state and custom hooks for state management.- Customer data management

- No external state management library required.- Appointment oversight system



### 9. Styling#### Staff Dashboard

- Global, responsive, RTL, and variable CSS in `src/styles/`.- Appointment management interface

- Custom fonts and modern UI.- Customer information access

- Schedule visualization

### 10. Deployment

- Ready for deployment on Vercel (see `vercel.json`).### 6. Component System

- Vite build configuration for optimized production builds.```typescript

interface ComponentArchitecture {

---  atomic: {

    atoms: ButtonProps & InputProps & IconProps;

This document provides a clear overview of all features and technical requirements for both users and developers working on the MiraBeauty project.    molecules: CardProps & FormProps;
    organisms: HeaderProps & FooterProps;
  };
  layouts: {
    responsive: boolean;
    rtlSupport: boolean;
    gridSystem: CSS.GridSystem;
  };
}
```

### 7. State Management
- Local component state using React hooks
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- LocalStorage for persistence
- Context API for global state

### 8. Data Models

```typescript
interface CoreModels {
  User {
    id: string;
    role: UserRole;
    profile: UserProfile;
    preferences: UserPreferences;
  }
  
  Product {
    id: string;
    details: ProductDetails;
    inventory: InventoryStatus;
    pricing: PricingInfo;
  }
  
  Service {
    id: string;
    duration: number;
    price: number;
    availability: TimeSlot[];
  }
  
  Appointment {
    id: string;
    customer: User;
    service: Service;
    dateTime: DateTime;
    status: AppointmentStatus;
  }
}
```
